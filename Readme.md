# Microservices Learning Program - Calendar Application

A comprehensive 6-week program for learning microservices architecture through building a calendar management system.

## üéØ Program Overview

This hands-on learning program guides you through building a complete calendar application, starting from a monolithic architecture and progressively decomposing it into microservices. You'll learn essential skills including service decomposition, contract testing, integration testing, and external service integration.

## üìö What You'll Learn

- Microservices architecture principles and patterns
- Service decomposition strategies
- Inter-service communication (REST APIs, message queues)
- Contract testing with Spring Cloud Contract
- Integration testing with Testcontainers
- External service integration
- Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Spring Boot configuration management
