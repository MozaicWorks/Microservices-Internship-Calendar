## Day 2: Notification Service and Asynchronous Testing

### Step 5: Design Notification Service Architecture (30 minutes)

**Objective**: Plan an asynchronous notification service that handles email and SMS reminders.

**Notification Service Responsibilities**:
- Process notification requests asynchronously
- Handle email and SMS delivery
- Manage notification preferences and templates
- Retry failed notifications with exponential backoff
- Track delivery status and analytics

**Asynchronous Processing Pattern**:
Event Triggered â†’ Message Queue â†’ Notification Service â†’ External API â†’ Delivery Confirmation

**Tasks**:
1. Plan message-driven architecture with RabbitMQ
2. Design notification types (event reminders, calendar sharing, payment confirmations)
3. Plan external service integration (email SMTP, SMS API)
4. Design retry and error handling mechanisms

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Clear understanding of notification service architecture
- [ ] Message-driven design planned
- [ ] External service integration strategy defined
- [ ] Async processing patterns identified

### Step 6: Implement Notification Service (75 minutes)

**Objective**: Create a notification service with asynchronous message processing.

**Tasks**:

1. **Create Notification Service Project**:
   - Set up new Spring Boot project for notifications
   - Add dependencies: Spring AMQP, Mail, WebClient, JPA
   - Configure to run on port 8084

2. **Create Core Entities**:
   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Notification {
       private Long id;
       private Long userId;
       private NotificationType type; // EMAIL, SMS
       private String recipient;
       private String subject;
       private String content;
       private NotificationStatus status; // PENDING, SENT, FAILED
       private Integer retryCount;
       private LocalDateTime scheduledAt;
       // getters, setters, timestamps
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Message Listeners**:
   ```java
   @RabbitListener(queues = "notification.events")
   public class NotificationEventListener {
       
       @RabbitHandler
       public void handleCalendarSharedEvent(CalendarSharedEvent event) {
           // Create notification request
           // Schedule for immediate processing
       }
       
       @RabbitHandler
       public void handleEventReminderEvent(EventReminderEvent event) {
           // Create notification request
           // Schedule for 15 minutes before event
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Implement Notification Processing**:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class NotificationService {
       
       @Async
       public void processNotificationAsync(Long notificationId) {
           // Process notification based on type
           // Handle failures with retry logic
           // Update status in database
       }
       
       @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 60000)
       public void processScheduledNotifications() {
           // Find pending notifications due for processing
           // Process each notification asynchronously
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Add External Service Clients**:
   - EmailService: Use JavaMailSender for email delivery
   - SmsService: Use WebClient for SMS API integration
   - Implement proper error handling and timeouts

6. **Configure Docker Compose**:
   Add notification service and database to docker-compose.yml

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Notification Service processes messages asynchronously
- [ ] Email and SMS delivery work with external services
- [ ] Failed notifications are retried with exponential backoff
- [ ] Service integrates with message queue properly

### Step 7: Create Comprehensive Async Testing (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Test asynchronous message processing with Testcontainers.

**Tasks**:

1. **Set Up Async Testing Infrastructure**:
   ```java
   @SpringBootTest
   @Testcontainers
   class NotificationServiceAsyncTest {
       
       @Container
       static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>("postgres:14");
       
       @Container
       static RabbitMQContainer rabbitmq = new RabbitMQContainer("rabbitmq:3.8-management");
       
       @MockBean
       private EmailService emailService;
   }
   ```

2. **Test Message Processing**:
   - Publish events to RabbitMQ
   - Verify notifications are created in database
   - Use Awaitility to wait for async processing
   - Mock external services (email, SMS)

3. **Test Retry Logic**:
   - Mock service failures
   - Verify retry count increases
   - Test permanent failure after max retries

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test processing 100+ notifications
   - Verify processing completes within time limits
   - Check no memory leaks or resource issues

**Key Testing Patterns**:
- Use `@Testcontainers` for realistic environments
- Use `await().atMost(Duration.ofSeconds(10))` for async testing
- Mock external services to avoid real API calls
- Test both success and failure scenarios

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Async message processing tests pass reliably
- [ ] Notification retry logic is thoroughly tested
- [ ] Performance tests validate system can handle load
- [ ] Message queue integration works correctly

## Testing Your Implementation

### Service-Level Integration Testing
```bash
# Run individual service integration tests
cd notification-service && mvn test -Dtest=*IntegrationTest
```

### Cross-Service Integration Testing
```bash
# Build Docker images for testing
docker build -t notification-service:test notification-service/

# Run multi-service integration tests
mvn test -Dtest=MultiServiceIntegrationTest
```

### End-to-End Workflow Testing
1. Start all services with `docker-compose up`
2. Execute complete workflow tests
3. Verify async processing works end-to-end

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Testcontainers Issues
- **Container startup failures**: Check Docker memory limits
- **Port conflicts**: Use dynamic ports in tests
- **Slow tests**: Enable container reuse with `testcontainers.reuse.enable=true`

### Async Processing Issues
- **Messages not processed**: Check queue configuration and bindings
- **Notification failures**: Verify external service connectivity
- **Performance issues**: Monitor database connections and thread pools

### Integration Test Debugging
- **Multi-service failures**: Check container logs with `docker logs`
- **Connectivity issues**: Test with `docker exec container ping other-container`
- **Test data cleanup**: Ensure proper isolation between tests
