## Day 1: Sharing Service and Data Consistency

### Step 1: Design Sharing Service Architecture (30 minutes)

**Objective**: Plan the final service that handles calendar sharing and permissions.

**Sharing Service Responsibilities**:
- Manage calendar sharing permissions (read, write, admin)
- Handle sharing invitations and acceptances
- Validate user permissions for calendar operations
- Track sharing history and audit logs

**Data Consistency Challenges**:
- Ensuring shared calendar permissions are consistent across services
- Handling permission changes that affect multiple users
- Managing eventual consistency in distributed permissions

**Tasks**:
1. Design sharing entity model (SharedCalendar, Permission, Invitation)
2. Plan permission validation workflow
3. Design APIs for sharing operations
4. Plan integration with Calendar and User services

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Clear understanding of sharing service boundaries
- [ ] Permission model designed
- [ ] Integration points identified
- [ ] Data consistency strategy planned

### Step 2: Implement Sharing Service (60 minutes)

**Objective**: Create the Sharing Service with permission management.

**Tasks**:

1. **Create Sharing Service Project**:
   - Set up new Spring Boot project
   - Configure to run on port 8085
   - Add standard dependencies (Web, JPA, AMQP)

2. **Create Core Entities**:
   ```java
   @Entity
   public class SharedCalendar {
       private Long id;
       private Long calendarId;
       private Long ownerId;
       private Long sharedWithUserId;
       private PermissionLevel permission; // READ, WRITE, ADMIN
       private SharingStatus status; // PENDING, ACTIVE, REVOKED
       private LocalDateTime createdAt;
       private LocalDateTime acceptedAt;
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Sharing Workflow**:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class SharingService {
       
       public SharingDto shareCalendar(ShareCalendarRequest request) {
           // 1. Validate calendar exists and user owns it
           // 2. Validate target user exists
           // 3. Create sharing record
           // 4. Send notification via message queue
           // 5. Return sharing details
       }
       
       public void acceptSharing(Long sharingId, Long userId) {
           // 1. Validate sharing invitation exists
           // 2. Update status to ACTIVE
           // 3. Notify calendar owner
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Add Permission Validation**:
   ```java
   @RestController
   public class PermissionController {
       
       @GetMapping("/permissions/calendar/{calendarId}/user/{userId}")
       public PermissionDto getUserPermission(@PathVariable Long calendarId, 
                                            @PathVariable Long userId) {
           // Return user's permission level for calendar
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Integrate with Other Services**:
   - Update Calendar Service to check permissions via Sharing Service
   - Publish events when calendars are shared
   - Handle permission validation requests

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Sharing Service handles calendar sharing workflow
- [ ] Permission validation works correctly
- [ ] Integration with other services functional
- [ ] Events published for notifications

### Step 3: Implement Data Consistency Patterns (45 minutes)

**Objective**: Handle data consistency across services for sharing operations.

**Tasks**:

1. **Implement Saga Pattern for Sharing**:
   ```java
   @Component
   public class CalendarSharingOrchestrator {
       
       public void shareCalendar(ShareCalendarCommand command) {
           // Step 1: Validate calendar ownership
           // Step 2: Validate target user exists  
           // Step 3: Create sharing record
           // Step 4: Send notification
           // Handle compensations if any step fails
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Eventual Consistency Handling**:
   - Use message queues for cross-service updates
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Add compensation actions for rollback scenarios

3. **Test Data Consistency**:
   - Test sharing workflow with service failures
   - Verify data remains consistent across services
   - Test concurrent sharing operations

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Sharing workflow handles failures gracefully
- [ ] Data consistency maintained across services
- [ ] Compensation actions work correctly
- [ ] Concurrent operations handled properly
