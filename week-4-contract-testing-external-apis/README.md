## Testing Your Contract Testing and External API Implementation

### Contract Testing Verification

**Provider Contract Testing (User Service)**:
```bash
# Run contract verification tests
cd user-service
mvn clean test

# Should generate and run tests like:
# - ContractVerifierTest.validate_shouldReturnUserWhenValidId()
# - ContractVerifierTest.validate_shouldReturn404WhenUserNotFound()

# Install stubs for consumers
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

**Consumer Contract Testing (Calendar Service)**:
```bash
# Run consumer contract tests
cd calendar-service
mvn test -Dtest=*ContractTest

# Tests should use WireMock stubs based on contracts
# Verify Calendar Service expectations are met
```

**Contract Evolution Testing**:
1. **Modify User Service API** (e.g., add required field to user response)
2. **Run contract tests** - should fail if breaking change
3. **Update contracts** if change is intentional
4. **Verify consumer can handle** the change gracefully

### External API Integration Testing

**End-to-End Payment Flow**:
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Test complete payment flow:
# 1. Register user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"premium@test.com","name":"Premium User","password":"password123","timezone":"UTC"}'

# 2. Login to get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"premium@test.com","password":"password123"}' | jq -r '.sessionToken')

# 3. Create calendar
CALENDAR=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/calendars \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Premium Calendar","color":"#FFD700","ownerId":1}')

# 4. Create payment intent
PAYMENT=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8083/api/payments/create-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"userId":1,"amount":500,"currency":"usd"}')

echo "Payment Intent: $PAYMENT"
```

**External API Failure Testing**:
1. **Stop external API mock** (WireMock)
2. **Attempt payment creation** - should fail gracefully
3. **Verify error handling** provides useful messages
4. **Test retry mechanisms** work correctly

### Performance and Reliability Testing

**Contract Test Performance**:
- Contract tests should run in <30 seconds
- Provider verification should be part of CI pipeline
- Consumer tests should use cached stubs when possible

**External API Performance**:
- Payment creation should complete in <5 seconds
- Handle external API timeouts gracefully (test with delays)
- Test concurrent payment processing (10+ simultaneous requests)

**Service Communication Testing**:
```bash
# Test service dependencies
# Stop Payment Service and verify Calendar Service handles gracefully
docker-compose stop payment-service

# Try to create premium event - should fail with appropriate error
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title":"Premium Event","premium":true,"calendarId":1}'
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Contract Testing Issues

**Contract Verification Fails**:
- **Check Base Test Class**: Ensure `ContractVerifierBase` properly mocks dependencies
- **Verify Contract Syntax**: Groovy DSL syntax errors will cause test generation failures
- **Mock Setup**: Ensure mocked service responses match contract expectations exactly
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Verify response status codes match between contract and implementation

**Consumer Tests Fail**:
- **WireMock Port Conflicts**: Ensure WireMock uses unique ports for each test
- **Stub Loading**: Verify contract stubs are generated and accessible
- **HTTP Client Configuration**: Check that test HTTP client points to WireMock
- **Request Matching**: Ensure actual requests match contract expectations

**Generated Tests Don't Compile**:
```bash
# Check generated test classes
ls target/generated-test-sources/contracts/
# Verify base class package and imports are correct
```

### External API Integration Issues

**Stripe API Connection Failures**:
- **API Key Issues**: Verify test API key is valid and properly configured
- **Network Issues**: Check internet connectivity and firewall settings
- **Rate Limiting**: Stripe has rate limits even for test mode
- **Request Format**: Verify request body format matches Stripe API expectations

**WireMock Test Issues**:
- **Port Conflicts**: Use dynamic ports or unique port assignments
- **Stub Matching**: Verify request patterns match exactly
- **Response Format**: Ensure mock responses match actual API response structure
- **Test Isolation**: Reset WireMock between tests

**Payment Service Errors**:
```bash
# Check Payment Service logs
docker-compose logs payment-service

# Common issues:
# - External API configuration missing
# - Database connection failures
# - Service-to-service communication timeouts
```

### Docker Compose and Multi-Service Issues

**Service Startup Failures**:
```bash
# Check service dependencies
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs service-name

# Verify environment variables are set correctly
docker-compose config
```

**Database Connection Issues**:
```bash
# Test database connectivity
docker exec -it payment-service ping payment-db
docker exec -it payment-db psql -U payment_service -d paymentdb -c "\dt"
```

**Service Communication Failures**:
```bash
# Test inter-service connectivity
docker exec -it payment-service curl http://calendar-service:8082/actuator/health
docker exec -it calendar-service curl http://user-service:8081/actuator/health
```

### Frontend Integration Issues

**API Endpoint Errors**:
- Verify service URLs are correct for each environment
- Check CORS configuration allows frontend domain
- Verify authentication tokens are included in requests
- Test each service endpoint individually

**Payment UI Issues**:
- Mock payment processing for development/testing
- Handle payment loading states properly
- Test error scenarios (declined cards, network failures)
- Verify premium event styling appears correctly
